# OrthoPromoTree
This repository is to build phylogentic trees from orthologous promoters previously constructed by OrthoPromo


**prepare the orthologous promoters**

if your orthologous promoters are in a directory following this pattern:
```
dir/{Gene}/{one_fasta_per_species}
```
you'll need to combine them into one single fasta per gene including all species with their names in the header.
